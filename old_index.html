                  <p>The unusual robbery attempt, which took place at the 4300 block of West 26th Street at about 9:30 am, happened as the driver of a Garda armored car stepped out of the vehicle. Shortly after, the male suspect allegedly hit the driver with the sledgehammer while trying to rob the man, according to FBI, which has since taken over the case.</p>

                  <p>Bystanders found the suspect, who fled after being shot, at a nearby intersection. From there, the Chicago Police Department took the suspect into custody from that intersection, and took him to Mount. Sinai Hospital roughly four4-and-a-half miles away from the scene of the alleged crime.</p>

                  <p>While the robbery suspect is currently undergoing surgery, “the Garda employee suffered non-life-threatening, but life altering, wounds,” the FBI said in a statement, with no further information to share.</p>

                  <p>The nature of the incident puts it under the FBI’s purview. "Robbing a bank or an armored car is a federal offense and will be investigated by the FBI in the northern district of Illinois," said special agent Garrett Croon, spokesperson for the FBI via email, referring to Title 18, Section 2113 of the United States Code.</p>
